        <h2>server mission statement</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to facilitate an environment where students who struggle with procrastination and loneliness have a place where they can study, achieve their goals, but at the same time make some truly motivating and lasting friends. We provide the environment, but the community will be built upon your needs and requirements for you by you. We hope one day we can have a server filled with passionate people who motivate and drive each other to achieve out-of-this-world unimaginable goals. We hope to see you a part of that too!</p>
